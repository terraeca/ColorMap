# Coding Challenge Education Horizon


React + Vite was used to complete this project. The application will perform rectangular motion drawing, starting from the centre filling all available space on the canvas with one of every colour, with an option to reverse the collour array. 

## The Challenge

The Challenge
Produce an image in which each colour occurs exactly once — with no repetition and no unused colours.
For the purpose of this challenge; colours are made up of three components — red,
green, and blue. We require you to break each colour component into 32 steps — 8,
16, 24 .. 256 — When combined, you will have 32,768 discrete colours to
utilise.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) to install the necessary libraries contained on package.json.

On the root of the project, run the following command
```bash
npm install
```

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default the application will run on localhost on port **5173**
